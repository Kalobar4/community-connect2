# Community-Connect

The goal of our app is to connect communities through event engagement. We see a need to connect people with those around them, and a niche market not served by broader post-based apps like next door. Recently there has been recognition of this need by facebook and others who are adapting their platforms to "micro-communities" with the intent of bringing people closer together. Our app platform takes an initial step toward that goal.

This project is managed through React and published in Heroku at the following link...TBD... or can be run locally in yarn at port 3000 client/3001 server concurrently.

The React file structure is as follows:
